# Genify-Task
The goal of this assignment is for us to assess your API building skills, and the tasks in this assignment mirror the kind of work
you would be doing at Genify as a Software Developer. Namely:
inherit the work of a Data Scientist, with some but for sure incomplete explanations on the model built
be tasked with building a system with little specifications, but instead some business needs for you to enquire/think about
and translate into system requirements
be given some messy references to earlier work
have few opportunities to interact with the rest of the team given everyone is busy and the team is spread across time
zones
